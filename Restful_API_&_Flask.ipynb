GET requests are designed to retrieve data from a server without modifying any resources, with parameters visibly appended to the URL in the query string, making them ideal for search queries and page navigation but limiting their data capacity and security for sensitive information. In contrast, POST requests send data in the request body rather than the URL, allowing for larger data transfers and better security since the information isn't visible in browser history or server logs, making them suitable for submitting forms, uploading files, or creating new resources on the server. While GET requests are considered \"safe\" and idempotent (meaning multiple identical requests will produce the same result), POST requests can alter server state and potentially create different outcomes when repeated, which is why browsers typically warn users when resubmitting POST data but not when refreshing GET requests.\n",

This modular approach promotes cleaner and more maintainable code, especially for larger applications. Blueprints enable the reuse of code across multiple parts of the application, as well as easier testing and scalability. For example, you could have separate blueprints for different parts of the app, such as user authentication, admin panel, or API routes, each responsible for its own set of views and logic.

Having a well-defined API specification is essential when building a Flask API because it provides clear guidelines for developers on how the API should behave, what data it expects, and what it returns. It helps ensure consistency, facilitates communication among team members, and allows for better testing, documentation, and integration with other services.

The session data is stored on the client-side in cookies, but it is securely signed to prevent tampering. Flask's session object simplifies managing temporary data by automatically handling the creation and expiration of sessions. For example, you can store a user's authentication status in the session, so they remain logged in between requests without needing to re-authenticate every time.
